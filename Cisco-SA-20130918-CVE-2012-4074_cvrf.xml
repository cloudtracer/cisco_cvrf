  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Computing System Serial over LAN (SoL) implementation  could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.



The vulnerability occurs because the Board Management Controller (BMC) uses a hard-coded private key. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting an SoL connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view or
modify SoL communications.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, it is likely that an attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside to intercept SoL communications. This access requirement limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
