  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Web Interaction Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against the user of the web interface of the affected system. 



The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization of the Cisco Unified Web Interaction Manager. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to visit a malicious web page that is designed to submit an HTTP POST request to the web interface of the affected product. If the user visits the malicious page, the attacker could execute arbitrary script in the browser of the user in the security context of the affected site.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
