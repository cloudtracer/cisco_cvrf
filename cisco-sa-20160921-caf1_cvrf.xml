    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Application-hosting Framework (CAF) component for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software with the IOx feature set could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a CAF user to download a file controlled by the attacker. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting crafted HTTP headers into the communication path between the user and CAF. An exploit could allow the attacker to force the user to download a file controlled by the attacker.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
