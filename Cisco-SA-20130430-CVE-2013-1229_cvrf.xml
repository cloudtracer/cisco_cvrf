  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the 64-bit SNMP server of Cisco TelePresence Management Suite (TMS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to terminate the TMSSNMPService.exe process.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending SNMP traps to a 64-bit TMS server. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial denial of service condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would likely need access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted SNMP traps to the targeted system. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful attack.



Customers are advised to review the bug reports in the Vendor Announcements section for a current list of affected versions.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and DoS attacks. For configuration details, consult Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists.["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"]



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
