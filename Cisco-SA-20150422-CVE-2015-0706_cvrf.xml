  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject a crafted HTTP header that causes users to be redirected to a malicious website.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input before it is used as an HTTP header value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct a web page redirection attack.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.



Cisco would like to thank Or Moran, Lior Neumann, Liad Mizrachi, and Oded Vanunu from Check Point Security Research Team for reporting this vulnerability.
