  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Web and E-Mail Interaction Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to capture, forge, or brute force a session identifier transmitted as a parameter in GET requests.



The vulnerability is due to improper use of session identifiers in GET requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by capturing, forging, or brute forcing a session identifier and injecting it into a GET request. An exploit could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary text into existing conversations.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside to capture, forge, or brute force a session identifier originating from a targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
