  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of the Cisco Broadcast Access Center for Telco and Wireless (BAC-TW) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the Cisco BAC-TW web interface. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make changes to the Cisco BAC-TW on behalf of the user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
