  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by copying large files to the device file system. Processing the large files could cause the device to stop responding, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have authentication credentials to log in to the device and privileges that allow copying large files to the file system. These restrictions greatly reduce the potential for exploitation.</Note>
