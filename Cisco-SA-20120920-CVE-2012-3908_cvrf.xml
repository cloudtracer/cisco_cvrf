  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Identity Services Engine contains multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input processed by the ISE Administrator user interface of the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing an authorized user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the affected application, which could be used to conduct further attacks.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in software release notes and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco has corrected this vulnerability by adding a filter to Tomcat as a safeguard to the Administrator user interface.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
