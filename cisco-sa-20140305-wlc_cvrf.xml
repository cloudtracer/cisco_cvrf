Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the WebAuth feature of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to deallocate memory used during the processing of a WebAuth login. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of WebAuth requests at a high rate and leave them in an uncompleted state. An exploit could allow the attacker to consume all available memory on the device. This causes a watchdog process to restart the WLC, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) while the device reboots.



The WebAuth feature must be enabled and configured for a device to be affected by this vulnerability. This feature is disabled by default.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2014-0701</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-114902</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114905</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188109</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188110</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188675</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188676</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco Wireless LAN Controller IGMP Version 3 Denial of Service Vulnerability, or Cisco Wireless LAN Controller MLDv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Unauthorized Access to Associated Access Points Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take complete control of an AP that has been associated to an affected Cisco WLC.

The vulnerability is due to a race condition that could result in the administrative HTTP server of an affected access point being enabled even though it is explicitly disabled by an administrator. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device using locally-stored credentials of the AP. A successful attack could allow an attacker to take complete control of the affected AP and make arbitrary changes to the configuration.



In many deployment scenarios, the locally-stored default AP username and password has not been changed from the factory default. In these zero-touch scenarios, the devices are designed to connect automatically to a WLC and download firmware and configurations.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2014-0703</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-188109</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188110</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco Wireless LAN Controller IGMP Version 3 Denial of Service Vulnerability, or Cisco Wireless LAN Controller MLDv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of a specific field in certain IGMP message types. When messages are processed, the IGMP subsystem may perform a memory over-read. When subsequent processing is performed on the extraneous data an error may occur that results in a reload of the device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a malicious IGMP version 3 message onto the network that will be received and processed by an affected WLC. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a critical error on the WLC, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.



The IGMPv3 Snooping feature is disabled by default and must be explicitly configured by an administrator for a device to be vulnerable.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2014-0704</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-61493</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-64988</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-64989</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-64990</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-64991</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-65081</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-65082</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-69367</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-69368</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-69369</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-69370</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82267</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82268</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82270</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82271</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82272</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82273</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82274</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82276</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82277</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-82279</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88659</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88660</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88661</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88662</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88663</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88664</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88665</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88666</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-88667</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100594</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-100595</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109053</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109054</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109055</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109056</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109058</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109059</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109060</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-109061</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114900</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114902</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114903</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114904</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-114905</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188675</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188676</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco Wireless LAN Controller IGMP Version 3 Denial of Service Vulnerability, or Cisco Wireless LAN Controller MLDv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload.

The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly parse malformed MLD version 2 messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malformed MLDv2 packet to a multicast-enabled network that the Cisco WLC is listening for. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a critical error on the WLC, resulting in a DoS condition while the device restarts.



The MLDv2 Snooping feature is disabled by default and must be explicitly configured by an administrator for a device to be vulnerable.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2014-0705</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-188109</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188110</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194375</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194376</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194377</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194378</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-194379</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Denial of Service Vulnerability, Cisco Wireless LAN Controller IGMP Version 3 Denial of Service Vulnerability, or Cisco Wireless LAN Controller MLDv2 Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload. Repeated exploitation could result in a sustained DoS Condition.



Successful exploitation of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Unauthorized Access to Associated Access Points Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to take complete control of an AP that has been associated to an affected Cisco WLC.



Successful exploitation of either of the vulnerabilities identified as Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Crafted Frame Denial of Service Vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause an affected device to reload.
