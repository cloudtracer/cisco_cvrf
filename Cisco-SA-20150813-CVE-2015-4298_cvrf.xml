  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Interaction Manager web interface could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view, modify, and delete data without proper authorization.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data against the application authorization control logic.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.



Cisco would like to thank Jakub Kaluzny of Securing.pl for reporting this vulnerability.</Note>
