  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Prime Collaboration Deployment of Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive data.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient protections of data at rest. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by browsing to a specific URL. An exploit could allow the attacker to view system root credentials.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access root credentials on the targeted device. These credentials could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the device.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
