  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco SA 500 Series Security Appliances firmware contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL code on a system.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the Cisco SA 500 Security Appliance web-based management interface.  

An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the targeted device.  If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL code and access sensitive information in the database.

Cisco confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and released software updates.





Remote management features on affected devices are disabled by default.  Only those devices that have remote management features enabled are vulnerable to exploitation.

Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
