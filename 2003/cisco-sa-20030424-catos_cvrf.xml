  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1">
    <Title>Cisco Catalyst Enable Password Bypass Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Catalyst software permits unauthorized access to the enable mode
in the 7.5(1) release. Once initial access is granted, access can be obtained
for the higher level "enable" mode without a password. This problem is resolved
in version 7.6(1). Customers with vulnerable releases are urged to upgrade as
soon as possible.</Note>
