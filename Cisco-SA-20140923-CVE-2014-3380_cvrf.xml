  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager
Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause high CPU utilization.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted TCP packets. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TCP packets
at a high rate. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause high CPU
utilization, which could impact operations of the affected system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send crafted TCP packets to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. 



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
