  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco TelePresence multipoint control unit (MCU) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of TCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a sequence of TCP packets to the affected system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send a sequence of TCP packets to the targeted system. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. 



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
