  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Platform Emulator could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a command injection attack.

 

The vulnerability occurs because the affected system improperly handles ucspe-copy command-line arguments. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using crafted command arguments on the system. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform a command injection attack, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
