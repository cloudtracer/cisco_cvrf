  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Model DPQ3925 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 Wireless Residential Gateway with Embedded Digital Voice Adapter (EDVA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the user of the web interface.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.



This vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Chris Watts of Tech Analysis. Cisco would like to thank him for reporting this vulnerability to Cisco PSIRT.
