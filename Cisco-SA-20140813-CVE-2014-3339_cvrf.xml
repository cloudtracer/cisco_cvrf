  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in certain pages of the administrative web interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) and Cisco Unified IM and Presence Server (formerly Cisco Unified Presence Server) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a number of different SQL injection attacks.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL statements by the application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious request to an affected page. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to read or modify portions of the underlying database.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
