      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the configuration of the XML parser of Cisco Prime Service Catalog could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive data or cause system resource consumption that could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML external entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted HTTP requests to the Prime Service Catalog Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based web services. To complete a successful attack, the attacker also needs a server that is reachable from the Cisco Prime Service Catalog. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access data stored on the host operating system, consume system resources, or cause a DoS condition. The disclosed data could contain sensitive information, which may include private keys and passwords.</Note>
