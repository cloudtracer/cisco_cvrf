  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) protocol implementation of the Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) ASR 5000 for Cisco Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition due to the hamgr process restarting.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the PMIPv6 packet header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PMIPv6 packet to the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a partial DoS condition because the hamgr process could restart when parsing the crafted PMIPv6 packet.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities not are available.
