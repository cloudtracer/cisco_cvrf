  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the certificate generation process in the admin web interface of the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on an affected system with root-level privileges.

 

The vulnerability is due to the improper validation of parameters passed to the affected system scripts. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing arbitrary commands as arguments to the affected fields of the web interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the underlying system with root-level privileges.
