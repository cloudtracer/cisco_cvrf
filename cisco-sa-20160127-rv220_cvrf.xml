    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges on a targeted device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of HTTP request headers that are sent to the web-based management interface of an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request that contains malicious SQL statements to the management interface of a targeted device. Depending on whether remote management is configured for the device, the management interface may use the SQL code in the HTTP request header to determine user privileges for the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authentication on the management interface and gain administrative privileges on the device.

Cisco released a firmware update that addresses this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

    <Remediations>
      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>To work around this vulnerability, administrators can disable or restrict access to remote management functionality for an affected device.



Disable Remote Management 
Caution: If a WAN connection must be used to manage a device, do not disable remote management functionality for the device. Disabling this functionality will result in the loss of all remote management connectivity for the device and prevent use of Cisco QuickVPN to access the device.

By disabling remote management functionality, administrators help ensure that only users on the same LAN as the device can access configuration and other settings for the device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of an attempted or successful exploit. Remote management is disabled by default.

If remote management is enabled, administrators can disable it by doing the following in the management interface:


    
    In the navigation tree, choose Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access.
    Next to Remote Management, check the Disable check box.
    Click Save.

Restrict Access to Remote Management

If remote management functionality is required, administrators can restrict access to this functionality by allowing only specific IP addresses to access configuration and other settings for the device. Note that this workaround does not prevent an attacker from spoofing an IP address that is configured on the device. By default, access from any IP address is supported.

To restrict access to remote management, administrators can do the following in the management interface:


    In the navigation tree, choose Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access.
    Use the remote management IP address settings to specify which IP addresses can access device settings.
    Click Save.
