  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the lighttpd module of Cisco IOS XR could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected lighttpd process.



The vulnerability is due to a race condition while handling TCP sessions to the lighttpd module on the affected Cisco IOS XR device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of TCP sessions to be established with the lighttpd server on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the lighttpd process.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send numerous TCP sessions to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. 



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
