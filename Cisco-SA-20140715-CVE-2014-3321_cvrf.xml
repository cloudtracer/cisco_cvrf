    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in parsing crafted Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets in Cisco IOS XR Software for ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor chip and a line card processing traffic. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient logic in parsing MPLS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of crafted MPLS packets to be routed by a bridge-group virtual interface (BVI) on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor chip and a line card, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be on the same collision or broadcast domain of the targeted device in order to send crafted MPLS packets to the device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators may consider disabling MPLS label allocation for routes learned via BVI.



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. Cisco NetFlow can identify such activity. For more information about Cisco NetFlow, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.
