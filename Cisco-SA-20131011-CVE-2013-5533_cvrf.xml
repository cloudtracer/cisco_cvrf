  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the image upgrade facility of Cisco Unified IP Phones 9900 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute commands within the context of the underlying operating system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of input during the image upgrade process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inserting shell commands into a parameter using common techniques.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to authenticate and have local access to a targeted device. These access requirements decrease the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that proof-of-concept exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
