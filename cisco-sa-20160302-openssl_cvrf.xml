    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">On March 1, 2016, the OpenSSL Software Foundation released a security advisory detailing seven vulnerabilities and a new attack, referred to as the Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN) attack. A total of eight Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) were assigned. Of the eight CVEs, three relate to the DROWN attack. The remaining CVEs track low severity vulnerabilities.



DROWN is a cross-protocol attack that actively exploits weaknesses in SSL Version 2 (SSLv2) to decrypt passively collected Transport Layer Security (TLS) sessions. DROWN does not exploit a vulnerability in the TLS protocol or any specific implementation of the protocol.



To execute a successful DROWN attack, the attacker must identify a server that supports both SSLv2 and TLS, and uses the same RSA key pair for both protocols. The attacker must also be able to collect TLS traffic for the server.




This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1">
    <Title>Multiple Vendor SSL/TLS Implementation DROWN Information Disclosure Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in multiple vendor products using SSL/TLS could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened eNcryption (DROWN) cross-protocol attack and gain access to sensitive information.

 

The vulnerability is due to an implementation error in the SSLv2 protocol that could allow the use of weak Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) cipher suites within Transport Layer Security (TLS). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intercepting traffic between a targeted system and a vulnerable SSLv2 server that uses the same private key to observe and possibly decrypt one of the connections. The attacker could return the decrypted ciphertext to the targeted server and, judging by the server's responses, determine the secret keys used within the encrypted communication. An exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt the TLS session between the targeted client and SSLv2 server, which the attacker could leverage to gain access to sensitive information.</Note>

    <Title>OpenSSL Digital Signature Algorithm Private Key Processing Double Free Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="3">A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of malformed Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) private keys by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an application that uses a vulnerable version of OpenSSL to connect to an attacker-controlled server in an attempt to exchange malformed DSA private keys with the application. An exploit could cause a double free memory corruption condition that the attacker could leverage to cause a DoS condition.</Note>
