  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in some of the gadgets of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to collect sensitive information.



The vulnerability is due to sensitive information being transmitted within a gadget's GET request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by capturing the GET request of a SocialMiner gadget. An exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information of the user authenticated to the affected system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the position to capture a GET request of a SocialMiner agent. Typically, these systems would reside on trusted, internal networks, in which an attacker would likely need access. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
