  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to an error in input validation for the sed command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing crafted input to the sed command. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need local access to the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
