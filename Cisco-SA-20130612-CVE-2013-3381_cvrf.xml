  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the network stack of Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause excessive CPU utilization on the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient optimization of resources when the affected system is flooded with malformed UDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed UDP packets to UDP port 162 of the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause excessive CPU utilization on the affected system. CPU utilization returns to a normal state once the attack is terminated.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker may need access to a trusted, internal network to send malformed UDP packets to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Customers are advised to review the bug reports in the "Vendor Announcements" section for a current list of affected versions.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
