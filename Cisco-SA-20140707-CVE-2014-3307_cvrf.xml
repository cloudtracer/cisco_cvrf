  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the DHCP client implementation of Cisco Small Cell products could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute commands and possibly take full control of the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of crafted DHCP messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCP messages to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands and possibly take full control of the affected device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted requests to the affected software. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
