  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the log file handling for Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to change and modify the system log file. The log file could have executable code added to it that could be executed when the log file is viewed. 



The vulnerability is due to lack of proper input validation when the system log file is referenced. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP request with specially formatted HTTP payload. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute remote code on the affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
