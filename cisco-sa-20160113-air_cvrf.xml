    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet 1800 Series Access Point devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the device by using a default account that has a static password. By default, the account does not have full administrative privileges.



The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default user account that is created when the device is installed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device by using the default account, which could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device.



Cisco released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
