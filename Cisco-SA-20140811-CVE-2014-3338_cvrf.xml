  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the CTIManager module of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate input contained within Kerberos single sign-on (SSO) tokens. This vulnerability is only exposed when the Cisco CTIManager is enabled and single sign-on has been configured.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have authenticated access to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
