  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) code of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the DHCPv6 process on an affected device to crash.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed DHCPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed DHCPv6 packet to an affected device configured with DHCPv6 server functionality. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DHCPv6 process on an affected device to crash.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send malformed DCHPv6 packets to a targeted device. In addition, the targeted device must be configured with DCHPv6 server functionality. These requirements may reduce the possibility of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and denial of service attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. Cisco NetFlow can identify such activity. For more information about Cisco NetFlow, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
