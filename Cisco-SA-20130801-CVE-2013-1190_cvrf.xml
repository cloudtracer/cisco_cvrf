  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) C-Series Rack Server version 1.4 contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Cisco Integrated Management Controller (CIMC), which is used for management/monitoring of the Cisco UCS  Rack Server, to stop responding or a reboot of the CIMC.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to limit incoming connections to certain ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by running nmap against the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CIMC to stop responding or a reboot of the CIMC.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit the vulnerability the attacker may need access to trusted internal networks to run nmap against the targeted system. This access requirement may limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



To mitigate denial of service attacks, apply hardware rate limiter features to limit packets that require CPU processing. See vendor documentation for specific configuration instructions. For hardware rate limiting configuration details, see Cisco Catalyst 6500 Denial of Service (DoS) Protection Configuration Guide["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SXF/native/configuration/guide/dos.html#wp1141067"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
