  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco IP 8800 Series Phone web application could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the web server process to become unavailable, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability exists because the affected software fails to check the bounds of input data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the web server, which could cause the service to crash. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a buffer overflow and create a DoS condition on the targeted system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
