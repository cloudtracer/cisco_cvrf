  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the code of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Linux could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges to those of the root user.



The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of some internal functions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the system and calling the vpnagent with some options. An exploit could allow the attacker to obtain privileged access to the system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to the targeted device. These access requirements decrease the likelihood of a successful exploit.



This vulnerability can be exploited only on systems running on Linux platforms. Systems on Mac OS and Microsoft Windows platforms are not affected by this vulnerability.



Cisco would like to thank Graham Markall for reporting this vulnerability.</Note>
