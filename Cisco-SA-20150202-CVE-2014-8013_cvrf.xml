  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the TACACS+ command authorization feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause the system to reset.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of very long command-line interface (CLI) commands by the TACACS+ command authorization feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by being locally authenticated and executing a long CLI command that is subject to command authorization. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to a targeted system. These requirements would likely reduce the possibility of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
