  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Nexus 1000V could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) to report a Virtual Ethernet Module (VEM) as unavailable.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient prioritization for VSM/VEM heartbeat messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by preventing the successful delivery of heartbeat messages between a VSM and a VEM with a UDP flood, causing the VSM to report the affected VEMs as unavailable.



Cisco would like to thank Felix 'FX' Lindner, Recurity Labs GmbH, for reporting this issue to us.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would likely need access to a trusted, internal network in which the targeted device may reside. This access restriction limits the possibility of a successful exploit.



Customers are advised to review the bug reports in the "Vendor Announcements" section for a current list of affected versions.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to contact the vendor regarding future updates and releases.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and denial of service attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
