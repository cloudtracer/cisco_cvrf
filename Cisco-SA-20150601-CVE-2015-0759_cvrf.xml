    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Headend Digital Broadband Delivery could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks on the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released updated software.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Devices running a default configuration of an affected version of software are vulnerable.</Note>
