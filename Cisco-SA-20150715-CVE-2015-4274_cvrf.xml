  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a vulnerable web interface.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections on the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web page.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
