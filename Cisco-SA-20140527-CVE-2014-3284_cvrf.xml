  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) processing code of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, which could lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of certain malformed PPPoE packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed PPPoE packet to an IOS XE ASR1000 device configured with PPPoE termination. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, which could lead to a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted device to send malformed PPPoE packets to the device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and DoS attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. Cisco NetFlow can identify such activity. For more information about Cisco NetFlow, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
