    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco TelePresence Server devices running software versions 4.1(2.29) through 4.2(4.17) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload.

 

The vulnerability exists due to a failure of the HTTP parsing engine to handle specially crafted URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple URL requests to an affected device. The requests will eventually time out because negotiation from the client does not occur; however, each request consumes additional memory, resulting in memory exhaustion that causes the device to crash. If successful, the attacker could utilize all available memory resources, causing the device to reload.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
