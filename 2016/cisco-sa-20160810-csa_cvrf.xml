  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of Cisco Connected Streaming Analytics could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.



The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of sensitive information in a server response when certain pages of the administrative web interface are accessed. An authenticated attacker who can view the affected configuration page of an affected system could obtain a service password used for event and report notification. This could allow the attacker to use the affected service to send notifications as the authorized system if additional restrictions are not in place on the targeted service.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
