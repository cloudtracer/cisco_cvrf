  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the HTTP web-based management interface of Cisco FireSIGHT System Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a user-supplied value in the Device Management user interface (UI). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a specific link.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
