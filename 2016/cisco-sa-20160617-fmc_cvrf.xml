  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the HTTP framework of Cisco Firepower Management Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering of output data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link to a malicious site or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script in the context of the site or access sensitive browser-based information.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
