    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) devices running Cisco AireOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The  vulnerability is due to the presence of unsupported URLs in the web-based device management interface provided by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to access a URL that is not generally accessible from and supported by the management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability.
