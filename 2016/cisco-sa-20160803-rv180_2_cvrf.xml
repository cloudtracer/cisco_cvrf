    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of the Cisco RV180 VPN Router and Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root-level privileges.



Cisco has not released and will not release a firmware update to address this vulnerability. Mitigations for this vulnerability are available.

    <Remediations>
      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. The following two mitigations may help limit exposure to this vulnerability:




Disable Remote Management 




Caution: Do not disable remote management if the device is managed via the WAN connection. This will result in loss of management connectivity to the device. Disabling this feature prevents Cisco QuickVPN access.



Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can disable it using the Web Access screen: Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access. Check the box for Disabled in the Remote Management field.



Disabling remote management helps ensure that only users on the LAN could attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities. Remote management is not enabled by default on the device.




Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses



If remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of any. By accessing the configuration screen (Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access), an administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with specified IP addresses can access the device.</Description>
