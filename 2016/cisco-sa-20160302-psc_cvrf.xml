    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in password management administration of the Cisco Policy Suite (CPS) application could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain read-only access to information that is confidential and should have restricted access.



The vulnerability is due to the lack of a proper role-based access control (RBAC) implementation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to an affected Cisco CPS system. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain read-only access to information that should have restricted access.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
