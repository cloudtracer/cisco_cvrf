  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input packet processor of Cisco Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Cisco Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, and Cisco Nexus 6000 Series Switches running Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the SNMP application on an affected device to restart unexpectedly.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of SNMP Protocol Data Units (PDUs) in SNMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP packet to an affected device, which could cause the SNMP application on the device to restart. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP application to restart multiple times, leading to a system-level restart and a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
