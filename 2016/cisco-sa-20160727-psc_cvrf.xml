    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the HTTP web-based management interface of the Cisco Prime Service Catalog (PSC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of the affected system.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a user-supplied value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a specific link.
