    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient HTML iframe protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a user to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct click-jacking or other client-side browser attacks.
