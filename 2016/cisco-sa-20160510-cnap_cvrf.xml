  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Cloud Network Automation Provisioner (CNAP) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity of an affected system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that include SQL statements to a targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify or delete entries in some database tables, affecting the integrity of some functions.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
