    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a malicious web page.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of HTTP request parameters by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a crafted HTTP request to the web interface of the affected software, which could cause the web interface to redirect the request to a malicious web page at a specified URL. This vulnerability is referred to as an open redirect attack and is used in phishing attacks that get users to unknowingly visit malicious sites.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are now workarounds that address this vulnerability.
