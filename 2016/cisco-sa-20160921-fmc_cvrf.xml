    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in SSL inspection for Cisco Firepower Management Center and Cisco FireSIGHT System software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured do-not-decrypt rules in the SSL policy rule set.



The vulnerability is due to lack of verification of the user input parameters within the HTTP URL against the SSL certificate. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP URL to the targeted system. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured SSL inspection rules. The SSL inspection do-not-decrypt rule should force a connection to be permanently encrypted.


Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
