  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the driver processing functions of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco ASR 9001 Aggregation Services Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak on the route processor (RP) of an affected device, which could cause the device to drop all control-plane protocols and lead to a denial of service condition (DoS) on a targeted system.




The vulnerability is due to improper handling of crafted, fragmented packets that are directed to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted, fragmented packets to an affected device for processing and reassembly. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak on the RP of the device, which could cause the device to drop all control-plane protocols and eventually lead to a DoS condition on the targeted system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigations for this vulnerability.

    <Remediations>
      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, administrators can use an access control list (ACL) with the fragments keyword to configure an affected device to drop noninitial fragments. To avoid dropping valid fragmented traffic, implementation of this mitigation requires detailed knowledge of the network and careful configuration by a network administrator. For information about how the fragments keyword changes ACL behavior, see the Access Control Lists and IP Fragments["http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/8014-acl-wp.html"] white paper.</Description>
