  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Performance Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation performed on parameters that are passed via an HTTP GET request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to an affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the root user.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
