  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Finesse Agent and Supervisor Desktop Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the user of the web interface.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
