    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the interdevice communications interface of the Cisco IP Interoperability and Collaboration System (IPICS) Universal Media Services (UMS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to modify configuration parameters of the UMS and cause the system to become unavailable.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication for the interdevice communications interface access. An attacker could exploit this issue by accessing the interdevice communications interface and making changes to the UMS configuration, causing the system to become unavailable.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
