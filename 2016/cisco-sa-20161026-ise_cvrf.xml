  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient controls on Structured Query Language (SQL) statements. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
