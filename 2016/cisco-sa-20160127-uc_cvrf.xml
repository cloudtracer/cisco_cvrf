  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unity Connection (UC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious link. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
