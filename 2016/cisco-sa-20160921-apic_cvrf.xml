    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the installation procedure for Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) devices could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain root-level privileges.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect installation and permissions settings for binary files when installing the system software on a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the device and escalating their privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and take full control of the device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
