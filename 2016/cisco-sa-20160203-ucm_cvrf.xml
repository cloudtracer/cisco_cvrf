  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Communications Manager SQL database interface could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the confidentiality of the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.



The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
