  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the interface of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Deployment SQL database could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to impact the confidentiality of the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.



The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation for user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database.



For additional information, please refer to  https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection["https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection"].



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
