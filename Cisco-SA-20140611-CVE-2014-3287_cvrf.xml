  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in BulkViewFileContentsAction.java of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information.



The vulnerability is due to improper filename parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URL requests to a vulnerable device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to an affected device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
