  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to install and execute an arbitrary executable file with privileges equivalent to the Microsoft Windows operating system SYSTEM account.



The vulnerability is due to a lack of checks in the code for the path and filename of the file that is to be installed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially modified INF file. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands on the underlying Microsoft Windows host with privileges equivalent to the SYSTEM account.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to the targeted system. These requirements could reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



This vulnerability only affects installations of the vulnerable application on Microsoft Windows operating systems.



Cisco would like to thank Kostya Kortchinsky of the Google Security Team for reporting this vulnerability.</Note>
