  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the SNMP process on Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected process and a limited memory leak that affects the process.



The vulnerability is due to not freeing allocated memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of UDP packets to SNMP port 162 on the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a limited memory leak that affects only the SNMP process. The attacker could also cause a repeated reload of the affected process.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted requests to the affected software. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>Administrators are advised to contact the vendor regarding future updates and releases.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.



Understanding activity on the network provides information and visibility that can be used to identify potential security incidents. Organizations should log events from devices and review the logged data to provide insight into anomalies or malicious activity. For logging best practices, see Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_tech_note09186a0080120f48.shtml#logbest"].



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. NetFlow identifies such activity. For NetFlow configuration details, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and denial of service attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].</Description>
