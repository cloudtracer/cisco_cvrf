    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCth81055</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKEv1. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak on the affected device which could lead to a DoS condition.</Note>

        <Description>The following identification mechanism exist for this vulnerability.

Embedded Event Manager (EEM)
A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a memory leak that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the memory for the affected process on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade or reload the device to recover the lost memory at a suitable time. The example policy is based on a Tcl script that sends a syslog when the memory keeps dropping and reaches EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES and when the IKE buffers have dropped EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES times. If IKE buffers are freed the counter starts counting from zero. After generating the memory leak syslog the script re-initializes.
The Tcl script is available for download at the "Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community" at the following link: https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300["https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300"]. A sample device configuration is provided below.




event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_INTERVAL 20
event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_MAX_RUNTIME 5
event manager environment EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES 3
event manager environment EEM_FREE_MEMORY_THRES 70
event manager directory user policy "flash:/"
event manager policy eem_ike_mem_leak.tcl
