  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the processing of Network Time Protocol (NTP) packets by Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an interface wedge and an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient checks on clearing the invalid NTP packets from the interface queue. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of crafted NTP packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an interface wedge and an eventual denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability; however, there is a mitigation for this vulnerability.

        <Description>There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability; however, there is a mitigation for this vulnerability.



As a mitigation measure, customers can use an interface access list (ACL), limiting NTP traffic to that coming from known NTP peers. Detailed knowledge and careful configuration is required by the network administrators in order to avoid dropping valid NTP traffic by implementing such mitigation measures. Because the NTP protocol in this vulnerability uses UDP as a transport, it is possible to spoof the sender's IP address, which may defeat ACLs that permit communication to these ports from trusted IP addresses.</Description>
