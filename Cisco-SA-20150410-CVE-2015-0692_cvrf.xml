  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the status checking process of support remote access tunnels in the Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on a targeted system.

 

The vulnerability is due to improper use and handling of the pickle Python module by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted serialized objects to a targeted device. A successful exploit could be used to conduct further attacks.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must log in locally to the vulnerability device. The access requirement reduces the potential for exploitation.</Note>
