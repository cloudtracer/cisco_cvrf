  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework code of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of a parameter.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs an authenticated user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
