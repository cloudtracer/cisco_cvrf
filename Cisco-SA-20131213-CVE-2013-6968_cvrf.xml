  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the training registration page in Cisco WebEx Training Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to enumerate email addresses of registered attendees.



The vulnerability is due to registration error messages that allow a user to determine that an email address supplied during registration has already been specified by another registered attendee. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting multiple registration requests and viewing the resulting error messages to determine which email addresses have been submitted by other registered attendees.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, it is likely that an attacker would need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside, to submit registration request and also view the error messages. This access requirement reduces the possibility of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
