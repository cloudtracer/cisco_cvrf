    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco ASA Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) Services contains a Fragmented Traffic Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. 





Successful exploitation of this vulnerability on the Cisco ASA NGFW  could cause the device to reload or stop processing user traffic that has been redirected by the parent Cisco ASA to the ASA NGFW  module for further inspection.



There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but mitigations are available.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. This advisory is available at the following link:

        <Description>
If the vulnerability has been exploited on the Cisco ASA NGFW and the traffic is interrupted, as a mitigation, the Modular Policy Framework (MPF) configuration on the Cisco ASA that is used to direct the user traffic toward the Cisco ASA NGFW can be removed. This will cause all user traffic to bypass Cisco ASA NGFW module inspection and allow it to pass through the Cisco ASA without inspection provided by the ASA NGFW.



The following example shows how to disable the redirecting of web traffic to the Cisco ASA NGFW module from the Cisco ASA firewall:





ASA(config)# policy-map cx_traffic_policy

ASA(config-pmap)# class cx_traffic

ASA(config-pmap-c)# no cxcs





Note: Cisco ASA can be configured with fail-open under MPF configuration. The fail-open keyword sets the Cisco ASA to allow all traffic through, uninspected, if the Cisco ASA NGFW module is unavailable.



Alternatively, fragmented traffic can be disallowed on the Cisco ASA firewall. This will cause the Cisco ASA firewall not to accept any fragments on its interfaces. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not send any fragments to the Cisco ASA NGFW software module for inspection.



The following example shows how to disable processing of fragmented traffic on the Cisco ASA firewall:



ASA(config)# fragment chain 1 

Note: The above example will disable fragments on all the Cisco ASA interfaces. Fragmented traffic directed to and through the Cisco ASA will be dropped. Consequently, the Cisco ASA will not forward any fragmented traffic to the Cisco ASA NGFW or any of the configured modules.
