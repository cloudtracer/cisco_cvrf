    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a memory leak that could lead to a device reload.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKE version 1 (IKEv1).



Although IKEv1 is automatically enabled on a Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software when IKEv1 or IKE version 2 (IKEv2) is configured, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv1 packet.



In specific conditions, normal IKEv1 packets can also cause an affected release of Cisco IOS Software to leak memory.



Only IKEv1 is affected by this vulnerability.



An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability. 

This advisory is available at the following link:

Note: The September 25, 2013, Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory bundled publication includes eight Cisco Security Advisories. All advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software. Each Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct all Cisco IOS Software vulnerabilities in the September 2013 bundled publication. 

Individual publication links are in "Cisco Event Response: Semiannual Cisco IOS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication" at the following link:

        <Description>There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.



The following identification mechanism exists for this vulnerability.

Embedded Event Manager (EEM)
A Cisco IOS Embedded Event Manager (EEM) policy that is based on Tool Command Language (Tcl) can be used on vulnerable Cisco IOS devices to identify and detect a memory leak that is caused by this vulnerability. The policy allows administrators to monitor the memory for the affected process on a Cisco IOS device. When Cisco IOS EEM detects potential exploitation of this vulnerability, the policy can trigger a response by sending an alert to the network administrator, who could then decide to implement an upgrade or reload the device to recover the lost memory at a suitable time. The example policy is based on a Tcl script that sends a syslog message when the memory keeps dropping and reaches EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES and when the IKE buffers have dropped EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES times. If IKE buffers are freed the counter starts counting from zero. After generating the memory leak syslog message the script re-initializes. 

The Tcl script is available for download in Cisco Beyond: Embedded Event Manager (EEM) Scripting Community["https://supportforums.cisco.com/docs/DOC-30300"].



 A sample device configuration follows:






event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_INTERVAL 20
event manager environment EEM_MEM_LEAK_MAX_RUNTIME 5
event manager environment EEM_IKE_BUFF_INCR_THRES 3
event manager environment EEM_FREE_MEMORY_THRES 70
event manager directory user policy "flash:/"
event manager policy eem_ike_mem_leak.tcl
