Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers Session Initiation Protocol Denial of Service Vulnerability

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers HTTP Profiling Remote Code Execution Vulnerability 

There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability besides disabling the HTTP Profiling feature in the Cisco WLC.



Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers SNMP Unauthorized Access Vulnerability

CPU based Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be configured to restrict SNMP access to the affected WLC. After ACLs are defined, they can be applied to the management interface, the access point manager (AP-manager) interface, or any of the dynamic interfaces for client data traffic or to the Network Processing Unit (NPU) interface for traffic to the controller CPU.
