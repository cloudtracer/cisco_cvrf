    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">The Smart Install client feature in Cisco IOS Software contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.



Affected devices that are configured as Smart Install clients are vulnerable.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds for devices that have the Smart Install client feature enabled.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of image list parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Smart Install packets to TCP port 4786. An exploit could cause an affected Cisco Catalyst switch to crash, resulting in DoS condition.</Note>

    <Remediations>
      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than disabling the Smart Install feature. The Smart Install Feature is enabled by default on client switches. No configuration is needed in the client switches.



In certain versions of Cisco IOS Software, the Smart Install client feature can be disabled with the global configuration command no vstack. In certain versions of Cisco IOS Software where the command is available, the vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling the Smart Install client feature.



The following is the output of the show vstack config command in a Cisco Catalyst Switch with Smart Install client feature disabled:



switch#show vstack config  
 Role: Client (SmartInstall disabled)  
Vstack Director IP address: 10.1.1.100



Note: The no vstack global configuration command to disable the Smart Install client feature was introduced with the fix for Cisco bug CSCtj75729["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729"] ("Ability to shut Smart Install default service on TCP port 4786"). If a Cisco IOS Software release supports the Smart Install client feature but the no vstack command does not exist, the release does not contain the fix for Cisco bug CSCtj75729["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCtj75729"].



Additional mitigations that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the companion document "Identifying and Mitigating Exploitation of the Cisco IOS Software Smart Install Denial of Service Vulnerability," which is available at http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28655["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/viewAMBAlert.x?alertId=28655"].
