  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the OutlookAction LI of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to generate sensitive encrypted values.



The vulnerability is due to the return of a user's encrypted password. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating these sensitive values.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
