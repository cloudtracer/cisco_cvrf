    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Communications Manager 9.0 contains a vulnerability
that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to poison the
Location Bandwidth Manager (LBM) transaction records.



The
vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication of the remote LBM Hub
node in the Intracluster communication between LBMs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by poisoning the LBM transaction records to consume all available bandwidth pools.  An
exploit could allow the attacker to consume all bandwidth and deny
calls.</Note>
