  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS Software running on Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Cisco Nexus 3500 Platform Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to the device with the privileges of the root user with bash shell access.

 

The vulnerability is due to a user account that has a default and static password. This account is created at installation and cannot be changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the affected system using this default account. The account can be used to authenticate remotely to the device via Telnet (or SSH on a specific release) and locally on the serial console.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are available.

      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>For the following devices and Cisco NX-OS Software releases, this vulnerability is specific to remote access using Telnet or direct serial console access. A workaround to prevent exploitation via Telnet is to disable Telnet and use SSH for remote connections to the device. Note that no workaround is available for exploitation via direct serial console access.

The Telnet protocol is disabled by default on Nexus 3000 Series and 3500 Platform Switches. To determine whether the Telnet protocol is enabled, the administrative user can issue the show feature | incl telnet command:



# show feature | incl telnet
telnetServer          1          disabled



Note: This workaround does not apply to Nexus 3500 Platform Switches running Cisco NX-OS Software release 6.0(2)A6(1) because the default account can be used with SSH remote access in this software release. Administrators of devices running 6.0(2)A6(1) are advised to upgrade to a fixed release.
