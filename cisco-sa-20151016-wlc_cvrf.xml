    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Web Management GUI of the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger client disconnection.



The vulnerability is due to a lack of access control to the Cisco WLC Web Management GUI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the IP address of the Cisco WLC and triggering client disconnections. The attacker must reach the Cisco WLC management IP address on port 80 or port 443 via its wired interface.




Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. A workaround that mitigates this vulnerability is available. This advisory is available at the following link:
