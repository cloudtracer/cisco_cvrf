  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the ITM web server interface of the Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service on the targeted device.



The vulnerability is due to the ITM port being unable to deal with a TCP flood. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a TCP flood to an ITM port. An exploit could allow an attacker to cause the ITM web interface to become unavailable for the duration of the attack.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must send a TCP flood to a targeted device, which may reside on trusted, internal networks that the attacker would likely need to access. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
