  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in handling Real-Time Control Protocol (RTCP) traffic in Cisco Unified Border Element (CUBE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause traffic that is destined to an affected device and traffic that needs to be processed switched to fail.



The vulnerability is due to exhaustion of the interface input queue by the RTCP traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending RTCP packets in a specific sequence. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause traffic to fail that is destined to an affected device as well as traffic that needs to be processed switched.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside, to send RTCP packets to be processed by the device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and DoS attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. Cisco NetFlow can identify such activity. For more information about Cisco NetFlow, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.
