    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the IptAccountMgmt, IptFeatureDisplayPolicyMgmt,
IptFeatureConfigTemplateMgmt, and IptProviderMgmt pages of the
Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting
attack.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing an
authenticated user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or
visit an attacker-controlled website.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that proof-of-concept exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators are advised to run both firewall and antivirus applications to minimize the potential of inbound and outbound threats.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



Users are advised not to open email messages from suspicious or unrecognized sources. If users cannot verify that links or attachments included in email messages are safe, they are advised not to open them.



Users are advised not to open unsolicited email attachments.



Users are advised not to visit websites or follow links that have suspicious characteristics or cannot be verified as safe.
