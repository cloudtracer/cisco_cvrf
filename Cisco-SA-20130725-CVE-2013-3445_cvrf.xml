  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the firewall implementation of Cisco Identity Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause high CPU utilization and possibly the crash of some internal processes.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient implementation of the firewall rule to protect some open ports. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by flooding the affected system with malformed IP packets.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit the vulnerability the attacker may need access to trusted internal networks to be able to send large amounts of malformed IP packets to the targeted system. This access requirement may limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



To mitigate denial of service attacks, apply hardware rate limiter features to limit packets that require CPU processing. See vendor documentation for specific configuration instructions. For hardware rate limiting configuration details, see Cisco Catalyst 6500 Denial of Service (DoS) Protection Configuration Guide["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SXF/native/configuration/guide/dos.html#wp1141067"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
