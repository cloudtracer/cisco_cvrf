  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the guest portal of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.




The vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco PSIRT would like to thank David Robinson of Context Information Security for discovering and reporting several of the cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities to Cisco.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
