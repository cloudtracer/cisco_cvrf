  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a web page open redirection attack against a user's browser.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of a specific parameter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a malicious link.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted requests to the affected software. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
