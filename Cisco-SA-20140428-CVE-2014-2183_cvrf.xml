  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) module of Cisco IOS XE on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the processing ESP card.



The vulnerability occurs during the processing of a malformed L2TP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed L2TP packets over an established L2TP session. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected ESP card.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to a targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit attempt.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and denial of service attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. Cisco NetFlow can identify such activity. For more information about Cisco NetFlow, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.
