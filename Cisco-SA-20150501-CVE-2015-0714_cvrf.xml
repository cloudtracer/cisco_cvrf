  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Finesse Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of certain parameters passed via HTTP GET or POST methods to an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.



Cisco would like to thank Marcela Benetrix of the eSecure Security Assurance team for reporting this vulnerability.
