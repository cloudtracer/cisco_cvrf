  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in RSVP processing of Cisco IOS XR could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the RSVP process on the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of a malformed RSVP packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed RSVP packet to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the RSVP process on the affected device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send malformed RSVP packets to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. In addition, the attacker may need to obtain additional information such as whether the device has RSVP configured, which is a condition that must be met to exploit this vulnerability.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
