  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack
against the user of the web interface. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient CSRF protections. 



An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of
an affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an
attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the
affected web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link to a malicious site and persuade the user to follow the link by using misleading language and instructions.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
