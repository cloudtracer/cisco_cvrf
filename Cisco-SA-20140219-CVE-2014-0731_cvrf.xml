  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the administration interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access Java class files.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing a specific URL of the UCM administrative interface. An exploit could allow the attacker to access Java class files that are part of the UCM interface.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside to access the URL related to the administration interface on the device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
