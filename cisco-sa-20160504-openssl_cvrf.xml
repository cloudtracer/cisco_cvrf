  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">On May 3, 2016, the OpenSSL Software Foundation released a security advisory that included six vulnerabilities. Of the six vulnerabilities disclosed, four of them may cause memory corruption or excessive memory usage, one could allow a padding oracle attack to decrypt traffic when the connection uses an AES CBC cipher and the server supports AES-NI, and, lastly, one is specific to a product performing an operation with Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code (EBCDIC) encoding.



Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the OpenSSL package affected by one or more vulnerabilities. 



This advisory will be updated as additional information becomes available.

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1">
    <Title>OpenSSL Untrusted ASN.1 Structures Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the ASN.1 encoder in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to the way the affected software encodes certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted certificate to the targeted system. An exploit could cause the affected software to crash or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a targeted user running an application that is using the OpenSSL library. If the user has elevated privileges, a successful exploit could result in a complete system compromise.</Note>

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="2" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1">
    <Title>OpenSSL AES CBC Cipher Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="3">A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to decrypt and access sensitive information.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient padding checks by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by conducting a padding oracle attack if the attacker is in a man-in-the-middle position between a targeted system and a Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TLS/SSL) or Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) server supporting Advanced Encryption Standards New Instructions (AES-NI) and the connection uses an AES Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) cipher. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt sensitive information in encrypted packets, which could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.</Note>

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="3" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1">
    <Title>OpenSSL EVP_EncodeUpdate Function Overflow Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="5">A vulnerability in the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient bounds checks by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting large amounts of data to an application that uses the OpenSSL library on a targeted system. A successful exploit could trigger an overflow condition that results in heap corruption. The attacker could use the heap corruption to cause the application to crash or to execute arbitrary code in the security context of the user who is running the application. If the user is running the application with elevated privileges, the attacker could execute arbitrary code with those privileges and compromise the system completely.</Note>

    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="7">A vulnerability in OpenSSL could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting large amounts of specially crafted data to the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user or cause a DoS condition on a targeted system.</Note>
