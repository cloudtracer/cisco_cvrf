  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Mobility Services Engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect to a database replication port anonymously via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).



The vulnerability is due to the misconfiguration of the Oracle SSL service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an unprotected port. An exploit could allow the attacker to login as an anonymous user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks in which the targeted device may reside. This access requirement limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
