  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Local Packet Transport Services (LPTS) network stack of Cisco IOS XR for Cisco ASR9k could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a limited denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected platform.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of flow base entries by LPTS that can cause some TCP and UDP ports to be erroneously opened for network access. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending continuous connection attempts to the open ports and cause an exhaustion of services. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a limited denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected platform.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




Only devices that have enabled LPTS are vulnerable to exploitation, reducing the potential number of affected systems in most environments.</Note>
