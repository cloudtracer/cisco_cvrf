  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of the Cisco Unified Computing System could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper parameter input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting the string value of certain parameters to a value larger than the input buffer. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to corrupt the parameters values in the administrative web interface causing administrative sessions to be terminated.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to authenticate to a targeted device which may reside on trusted, internal networks in which the attacker would need access to. These access requirements limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
