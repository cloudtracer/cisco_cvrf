  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco NAC Appliance contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input processed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious URL. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session in the security context of the site that is hosted by the affected software.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
