  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the file upload filename parsing routine of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload a file with a malicious filename.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of uploaded filenames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file with a malicious filename. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload a file with a filename that could result in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when displayed in the ISE web interface.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
