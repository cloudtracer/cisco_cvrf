  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the SNMP module of Cisco IOS XR could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to trigger a memory leak in the SNMP process.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient checking of data input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SNMP packets to the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a memory leak in the SNMP process. The SNMP process will restart after it consumes its allocated memory.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must authenticate to a targeted device to send crafted SNMP packets. This access requirement limits the possibility of a successful exploit.



Customers are advised to review the bug report in the Vendor Announcements section for a current list of affected versions.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
