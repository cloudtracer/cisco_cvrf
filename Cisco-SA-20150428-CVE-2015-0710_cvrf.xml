  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV) processing code of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.

 

The vulnerability is due to improper processing of oversized OTV frames passing through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of packets that are processed as oversized OTV frames that may require fragmentation and reassembly by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be on the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
