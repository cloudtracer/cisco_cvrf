  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Vulnerabilities in the administrative web interface of Cisco Unified Operations Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute cross-site scripting attacks or hijack user sessions.



The vulnerabilities are due to a failure to properly validate user supplied input as well as inadequate cookie protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click on a specially crafted URL.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
