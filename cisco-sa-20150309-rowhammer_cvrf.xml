  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">On March 9, 2015, new research was published that takes advantage of a flaw in double data rate type 3 (DDR3) synchronous dynamic random-access memory (SDRAM) to perform privilege escalation attacks on systems that contain the affected hardware. The flaw is known as Row Hammer. To attempt an attack, the attacker must execute a malicious binary on an affected system.



In addition, the research focused on consumer hardware that did not have a number of mitigations and memory protections that have been integrated into chipsets and memory modules used in Cisco server-class products. Of note in the paper is that the researchers were unable, in their testing, to exploit devices that use Error-Correcting Code (ECC) memory.



Cisco offers a limited number of products that allow an unprivileged user to load and execute binaries.

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1">
    <Title>Row Hammer Privilege Escalation Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in DDR3 system memory request processing could allow a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on a local system.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of large amounts of memory requests by the hardware memory system. The attacker could use the vulnerability to manipulate the memory state and cause the system to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.</Note>
