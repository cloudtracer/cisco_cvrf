  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Catalyst 6500 Supervisor Engine 2T (Sup2T) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to crash the device.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing multicast traffic by the Sup2T. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to the router to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted packets to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and DoS attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. Cisco NetFlow can identify such activity. For more information about Cisco NetFlow, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



To mitigate DoS attacks, apply hardware rate limiter features to limit packets that require CPU processing. See vendor documentation for specific configuration instructions. For hardware rate limiting configuration details, see Cisco Catalyst 6500 Denial of Service (DoS) Protection Configuration Guide["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SXF/native/configuration/guide/dos.html#wp1141067"].</Description>
