  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of the Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to enumerate valid user accounts.



The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of a returned message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URL requests to a vulnerable device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted URL requests to the device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
