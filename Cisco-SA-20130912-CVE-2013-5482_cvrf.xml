  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Prime LAN Management Solution could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient HTML iframe protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a user to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. An exploit could allow the attacker to conduct clickjacking or other client-side browser attacks.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
