    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the policy code of Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center for VMware could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access the underlying Linux operating system with the privileges of the root user.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by bypassing policy restrictions and executing commands on the underlying operating system. The user needs to log in to the device with valid administrator-level credentials.
