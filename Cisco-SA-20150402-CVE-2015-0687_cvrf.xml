  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) code of Cisco Catalyst 4500 devices running Cisco IOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to an unspecified condition that exists during SNMP polling of an affected device that is configured for Virtual Switching System (VSS) with only one switch in the VSS cluster. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause an affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
