  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the diagnostic module of the Cisco Virtualization Experience Client 6000 Series could allow an authenticated, non-privileged, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.



The vulnerability is due to lack of input validation in the diagnostic module running on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting arbitrary commands.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to the targeted device. These systems typically reside on an internal, trusted network behind a firewall, decreasing the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
