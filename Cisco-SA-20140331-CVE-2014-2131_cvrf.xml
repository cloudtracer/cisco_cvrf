  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the packet driver code of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to how the packet driver code handles packets that belong to protocols that engage high priority queues, such as Virtual Switching Systems (VSS) or Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a number of BFD or VSS packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device that would lead to a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need access to the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the possibility of a successful exploit.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and DoS attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor network traffic for security-related network activity. Cisco NetFlow can identify such activity. For more information about Cisco NetFlow, see Introduction to Cisco IOS NetFlow - A Technical Overview["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6555/ps6601/prod_white_paper0900aecd80406232.html"].



To mitigate denial of service attacks, apply hardware rate limiter features to limit packets that require CPU processing. See vendor documentation for specific configuration instructions. For hardware rate limiting configuration details, see Cisco Catalyst 6500 Denial of Service (DoS) Protection Configuration Guide["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12.2SXF/native/configuration/guide/dos.html#wp1141067"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.
