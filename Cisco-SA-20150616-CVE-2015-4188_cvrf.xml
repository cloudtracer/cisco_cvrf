  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Prime Collaboration Manager interface could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impact the confidentiality of the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.



The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the database.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must submit malicious requests to the targeted system, making exploitation more difficult in environments that restrict network access from untrusted sources.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
