  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in multiple-state-changing URL application programming interface (API) functionalities within the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of an affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to convince the user to follow the link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
