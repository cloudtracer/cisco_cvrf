  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Lights-Out Management (LOM) functionality of the Sourcefire 3D System could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to the baseboard management controller (BMC) on an affected device.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation and sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files to the BMC on an affected device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the affected device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
