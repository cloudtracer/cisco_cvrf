  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user who is authenticated to the device to click a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions in the administrative web pages of the device with the privileges of the authenticated user.
Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security advisory and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.



Cisco would like to thank Yorick Koster of Securify for reporting this vulnerability.</Note>
