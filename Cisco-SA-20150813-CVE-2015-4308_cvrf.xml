    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Edge 340 webGUI configuration export functionality could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to view sensitive information stored on an affected system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.
