  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Posture module of the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary programs with elevated privileges.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system and executing commands that could lead to elevated privileges.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have local access to the targeted device. These requirements may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
