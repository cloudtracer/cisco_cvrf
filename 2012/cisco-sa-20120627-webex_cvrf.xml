The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of security vulnerability information that is related to Cisco products and networks. The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24x7 with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security issues with Cisco products and networks.

In some cases, exploitation of the vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of a targeted user. 



The Cisco WebEx Players are applications that are used to play back WebEx meeting recordings that have been recorded on a WebEx meeting site or on the computer of an online meeting attendee. The players can be automatically installed when the user accesses a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. The players can also be manually installed for offline playback after downloading the application from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"].



If the WRF or ARF players were automatically installed, they will be automatically upgraded to the latest, nonvulnerable version when users access a recording file that is hosted on a WebEx meeting site. If the WRF or ARF player was manually installed, users will need to manually install a new version of the player after downloading the latest version from http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html["http://www.webex.com/play-webex-recording.html"].



Cisco has updated affected versions of the WebEx meeting sites and WRF and ARF players to address these vulnerabilities.
