  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager (Cisco Unified CDM) is affected by the following vulnerabilities:


    Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
    Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability 
    Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability 

Successful exploitation of the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability or of the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability may allow an attacker
to execute arbitrary commands or obtain privileged access to the affected system.

Successful exploitation of the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability may allow an attacker to access and modify BVSMWeb portal user information
such settings in the personal phone directory, speed dials, Single Number Reach, and
call forward settings.



Cisco has released free software updates that address the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Privilege Escalation Vulnerability and the
Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability. 

Cisco will provide a free software update for the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability as soon as the fix is available.



Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available. Customers that are concerned about the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager BVSMWeb Unauthorized Data Manipulation Vulnerability may apply the
mitigation detailed in the "Workarounds" section of this advisory. 



Note: Due to an error in the fix of the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability, all Cisco Unified CDM Platform Software releases are
vulnerable regardless if a previous patch has been applied due to this security advisory. This advisory has been updated to provide additional information about the fix for the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Default SSH Key Vulnerability.

Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Application Software could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and gain
administrative access to the affected system.



The vulnerability
is due to improper implementation of authentication and authorization
controls of the Administration GUI. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by submitting a crafted URL to change the administrative credentials of a user.
The attacker needs to be authenticated to the system or convince a valid user of the Administration GUI to click a
malicious link.</Note>

    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCud41130</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="3">A vulnerability in the implementation of the framework that allows access to
support representatives of the Cisco
Unified Communications Domain Manager Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated,
remote attacker to connect to the affected system with the privileges of
the root user.



The vulnerability is due to the presence of
a default SSH private key, which is stored in an insecure way on the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by obtaining the SSH
private key. For example, the attacker might reverse engineer the binary file of the operating system.
This will allow the attacker to connect by using the support account to the
system without requiring any form of authentication. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to the system with the privileges of the root user.</Note>
