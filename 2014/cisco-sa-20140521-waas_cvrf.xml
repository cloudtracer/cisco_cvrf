    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) software versions 5.1.1 through 5.1.1d, when configured with the SharePoint acceleration feature, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exploit a buffer overflow and cause arbitrary code execution.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect buffer handling for SharePoint responses. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious SharePoint application. An exploit could allow the attacker to crash the application optimization handler and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges on the WAAS appliance.
