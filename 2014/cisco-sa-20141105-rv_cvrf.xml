    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">The Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall are affected by the following vulnerabilities:


    Cisco RV Series Routers Command Injection Vulnerability
    Cisco RV Series Routers HTTP Referer Header Vulnerability
    Cisco RV Series Routers Insecure File Upload Vulnerability

These vulnerabilities are independent of each other; a release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the others.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are available. This advisory is available at the following link:

      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the file upload routines of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations on the devices.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload files to an arbitrary location on the device.

        <Description>The following mitigations help limit the exposure to these vulnerabilities.



Disable Remote Management




Caution: Do not disable remote management if you manage the device via the WAN connection. This will result in loss of management connectivity to the device. Disabling this feature prevents Cisco QuickVPN access.



Remote Management is disabled by default. If it is enabled, administrators can disable it using the Web Access screen: Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access. Check the box for Disabled in the Remote Management field.



Disabling remote management helps ensure that only users on the LAN could attempt to exploit the vulnerabilities.




Limit Remote Management Access to Specific IP Addresses



If remote management is required, harden the device so that it can be accessed only by certain IP addresses, rather than the default setting of any. By accessing the configuration screen (Administration &gt; Management Interface &gt; Web Access), an administrator can change the Remote IP address field to ensure only devices with the specified IP addresses can access the device.

      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="3">A vulnerability in the network diagnostics administration pages of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the devices.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.

    <ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCuh87145</ID>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="5">A vulnerability in the administrative web interface of the Cisco RV120W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV180 VPN Router, Cisco RV180W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV220W Wireless Network Security Firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user who is authenticated to the device to click a malicious link. An exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions in the administrative web pages of the device with the privileges of the authenticated user.
