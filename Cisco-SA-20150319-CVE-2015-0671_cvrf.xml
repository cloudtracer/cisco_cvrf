  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the DNS subsystem of the Cisco Videoscape Distribution Suite for Internet Streaming (VDS-IS) used by Cisco services routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of specific packets processed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific packets to a targeted device. If successful, the attacker could cause the device to consume excessive amounts of CPU and network-level resources, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send specific packets to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. 



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



Administrators can help protect affected systems from external attacks by using a solid firewall strategy.



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
