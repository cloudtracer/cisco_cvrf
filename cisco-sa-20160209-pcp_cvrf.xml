  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of the Cisco Prime Collaboration server could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access the underlying Linux operating system with the privileges of the root user. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by bypassing policy restrictions and executing commands on the underlying operating system. The user needs to log in to the device with valid administrator-level credentials.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
