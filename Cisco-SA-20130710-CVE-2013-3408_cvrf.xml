  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the function handling the operating system permissions of Cisco Virtualization Experience Client 6000 Series could allow an authenticated, local attacker to take full control of the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the permissions for the underlying operating system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the system and executing a series of commands that could lead to escalated privileges. An exploit could allow the unprivileged attacker to escalate privileges and take full control of the affected system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system and the ability to authenticate to a privileged security context. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These access requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
