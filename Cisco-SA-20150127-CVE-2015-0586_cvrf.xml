  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Network-Based Application Recognition (NBAR) protocol process of the Cisco 2900 Series Integrated Services Router could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability occurs when the NBAR process locks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending simple IP version 4 (IPv4) packets through the router. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition that would require a router restart.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need to acquire additional information about the targeted device, such as whether the NBAR process is running on the Internet interface on the device.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
