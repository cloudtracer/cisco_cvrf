  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A
vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Communications
Manager (UCM) Unified CallManager Interactive Voice Response (CMIVR) interface could allow an unauthenticated, remote  attacker to
impact the integrity of the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.




The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation on user-supplied input
within SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted URLs that contain malicious SQL statements to the affected system. An exploit could allow
the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the
database.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
