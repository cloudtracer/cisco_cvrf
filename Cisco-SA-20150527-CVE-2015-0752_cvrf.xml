  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input submitted to and processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.</Note>
