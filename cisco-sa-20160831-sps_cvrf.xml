  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Plus (Sx220) Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack and perform arbitrary actions on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web-based management interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions on a targeted device via a web browser and with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has released firmware updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
