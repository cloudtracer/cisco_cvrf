  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of the Cisco UCS Central Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download arbitrary files from a targeted device.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve sensitive information.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to send crafted HTTP requests to the targeted device, making exploitation more difficult in environments that restrict network access from untrusted sources.



Cisco would like to thank Mr. Gregory Draperi for reporting this vulnerability.
