  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to expose passwords in plain text format.



The vulnerability is due to older versions of the affected software retaining the ability to decrypt passwords. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to expose passwords in plain text format.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
