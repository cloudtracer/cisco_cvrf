  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Safe Search enforcement component of Cisco ASA CX Context-Aware Security could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass security policy enforced by the affected component.



The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the logic that should perform the filtering action. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request through the affected system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have the ability to send a crafted HTTP requests through a targeted device which may reside on trusted, internal networks in which the attacker would likely need access to. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit. 



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
