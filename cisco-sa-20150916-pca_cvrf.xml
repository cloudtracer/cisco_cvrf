    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Software contains the following vulnerabilities:


    Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Web Framework Access Controls Bypass Vulnerability
    Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Information Disclosure Vulnerability
    Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability 



Successful exploitation of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Web Framework Access Controls Bypass Vulnerability and Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Session ID Privilege Escalation Vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to perform tasks with the privileges of an administrator for any domain or customer managed by the affected system.



Successful exploitation of the Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance Information Disclosure Vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker to access sensitive information, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) community strings and administrative credentials, of any devices imported in the system database.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate these vulnerabilities are not available.

      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Prime Collaboration
Assurance  could allow an
authenticated, remote attacker to access higher-privileged functions.



The
vulnerability is due to improper implementation of authorization and
access controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
a crafted URL to the system. The attacker would need to be logged in to
the system to exploit this vulnerability.



An exploit could
allow the attacker to access functions, some of which should be accessible only
to users who have administrative privileges.
Because of this vulnerability, an attacker could create an
additional administrative user or access information from another domain if the
system is used in multiple tenants environment.</Note>
