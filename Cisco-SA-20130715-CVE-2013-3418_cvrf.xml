  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust available memory and crash several critical processes. 



The vulnerability is due to improper memory allocation when the affected system receives crafted HTTP GET or POST requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through crafted HTTP GET or POST requests sent to the management interface of the affected system. An exploit could allow the attacker to consume the available memory, which will cause several critical processes to become unresponsive or not function properly. Management access to the system may also become unavailable. A full-system reload is needed to restore complete functionality.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to a targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
