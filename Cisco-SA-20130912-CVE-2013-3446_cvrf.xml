  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Digital Media Manager (DMM) contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the DMM to issue a redirect to an arbitrary third-party URL.



The vulnerability is due to an open redirect issue in the DMM login page. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specific URL pointing to the DMM login page with a parameter that could trigger the DMM to issue an HTTP redirect to a host under the control of the attacker.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, it is likely an attacker would need to access or control a host system that is able to communicate with the targeted device. In addition, the attacker would need to know the location of the device to point a crafted URL to the login page. Typically, these devices would be on trusted, internal networks behind firewalls. These access requirements decrease the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
