  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the site access control implementation of Cisco WebEx Business Suite could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject content from the attacker-controlled WebEx site into another WebEx site.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a crafted URL to inject content from the attacker-controlled WebEx site into another WebEx site.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement limits the possibility of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
