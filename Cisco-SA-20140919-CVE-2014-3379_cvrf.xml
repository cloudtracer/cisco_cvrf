  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in parsing of malformed Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets in Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco Network Convergence System 6000 Series Routers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor unit (NPU) and a line card that is processing traffic. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient logic in parsing MPLS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed MPLS packet to be processed by the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a lockup and eventual reload of a network processor unit and a line card, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit. In addition, the targeted device must be configured to process MPLS packets, which may require the attacker to obtain additional knowledge about the device prior to an exploit attempt.</Note>
