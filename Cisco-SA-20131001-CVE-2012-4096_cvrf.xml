  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) local file editor of
the Cisco Unified Computing System could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to modify the contents of arbitrary files on the fabric
interconnect.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly
sanitize user input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
issuing certain commands in the local file editor. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker invoke vi to edit system files.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to authenticate and have local access to the targeted device, which may reside on trusted, internal networks. These access requirements limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
