  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Search and Play interface of Cisco MediaSense could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the portal on the affected system.



The vulnerability is due to  insufficient input validation of a parameter. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by convincing a user to access a malicious link.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
