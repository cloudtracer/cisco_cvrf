    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the license upload interface of Cisco 8800 Series IP Phones could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete arbitrary files from the filesystem.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading invalid files to an affected device via the certificate upload interface for the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
