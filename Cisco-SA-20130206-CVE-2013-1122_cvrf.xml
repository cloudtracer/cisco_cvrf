  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Nexus 7000 M1-Series Modules contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of crafted packets processed by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to a targeted device. If successful, an attacker could cause the M1-Series module of the affected software to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to submit crafted packets to the targeted device, likely requiring the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. This access requirement limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Nexus 7000 contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected M1-Series module to reload.



The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of crafted packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to a device that is configured with Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV), where the physical interface of the connection is over the M1-Series module. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the M1-Series module to reload.</Note>
