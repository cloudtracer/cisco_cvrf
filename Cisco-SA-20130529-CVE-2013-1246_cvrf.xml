  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the
t-shell implementation of Cisco TelePresence System Software could allow
an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust the available
memory and create a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper handling of orphaned
t-shell sessions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by opening several Secure Shell (SSH) sessions with the affected
system. An exploit could allow the attacker to consume available
memory; therefore, the affected system may become
unreachable and unable to function properly. A hard reboot is
needed to restore complete functionality.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a Security Notice and software updates are available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must authenticate to a targeted system. This access requirement limits the possibility of a successful exploit.



Customers are advised to review the bug report in the "Vendor Announcements" section for a current list of affected versions.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
