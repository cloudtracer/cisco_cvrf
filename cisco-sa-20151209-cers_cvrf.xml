  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Emergency Responder server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against a user of the web interface. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of an affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser and with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
