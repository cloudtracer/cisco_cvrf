  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject a crafted HTTP header that could introduce arbitrary code into the web interface.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user input before it is used as an HTTP header value. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a crafted URL. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary HTML or script in a targeted user's browser.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.
