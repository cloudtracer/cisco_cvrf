  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Central software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) on a targeted system.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the user of the web application a crafted request. If processed, the attacker could gain access and perform unauthorized actions on the targeted system.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
