  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software versions for symmetric multi-processor (SMP) platforms contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger the device to crash.



The vulnerability is due to the SSL/TLS certificate handling code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a heavy SSL/TLS traffic load, which under selected circumstances may trigger the crash.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to generate large amounts of SSL/TLS traffic to be sent to an affected device. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and DoS attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
