  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the TCP packet input handler of the Cisco Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reset of the Session Manager application.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the length fields of the TCP/IP header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted TCP packet with an invalid TCP/IP header. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Session Manager application on an affected device to restart, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must send a crafted TCP packet with an invalid TCP/IP header to the targeted system, making exploitation more difficult in environments that restrict network access from untrusted sources.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to apply the appropriate updates.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



Administrators can help protect affected systems from external attacks by using a solid firewall strategy.



Administrators may consider using IP-based access control lists (ACLs) to allow only trusted systems to access the affected systems.



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
