  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the VPN authentication code that handles parsing of the username from the certificate on the Cisco ASA firewall could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to parallel processing of a large number of Internet Key Exchange (IKE) requests for which username-from-cert is configured. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of IKE requests when the affected device is configured with the username-from-cert command. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must send a large number of IKE requests to a targeted device, which may reside on trusted, internal networks that the attacker would likely need to access. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit. In addition, the targeted device must be configured with the username-from-cert command.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
