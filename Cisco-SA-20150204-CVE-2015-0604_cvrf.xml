  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Unified IP Phone 9900 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to the phone.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the server. An exploit could allow the attacker to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations on an affected device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send crafted HTTP requests to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. 



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
