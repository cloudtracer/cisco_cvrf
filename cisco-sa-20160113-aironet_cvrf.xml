  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the IP ingress packet handler of Cisco Aironet 1800 Series Access Point devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a complete denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of IP packet headers. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IP packet to an affected device. An successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability.
