  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (XSRF), and phishing attacks on the affected software.



The vulnerabilities are due to improper input validation of certain parameters passed to the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.



Cisco has confirmed these vulnerabilities and software updates are available.




To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.
