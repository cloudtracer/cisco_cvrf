    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) software that is used by Cisco Advance Malware Protection (AMP) for Cisco Email Security Appliances (ESAs) and Cisco Web Security Appliances (WSAs) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the AMP process to restart.



The vulnerability is due to improper parsing of input files by the libclamav library. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted document that triggers a scan from the AMP ClamAV library on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the AMP process to restart.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
