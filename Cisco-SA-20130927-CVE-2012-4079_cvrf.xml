  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the public XML API service of Cisco Unified Computing System
Fabric Interconnect could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
create a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to improper
input validation in the XML API service. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a malformed XML packet. A successful exploit
could cause the XML API service to stop responding.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send malformed XML packets to the targeted device, which may reside on trusted, internal networks to which the attacker would likely need access. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
