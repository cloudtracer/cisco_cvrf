  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco WebEx Meeting Center web interface could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to redirect a user to a undesired web page. 



The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of the parameters in the HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting an HTTP request that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a specified malicious Uniform Resource Locator (URL).



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
