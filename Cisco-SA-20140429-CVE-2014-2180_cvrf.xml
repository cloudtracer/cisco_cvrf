  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Document Management of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient parameter validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted data to the web server.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to a targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
