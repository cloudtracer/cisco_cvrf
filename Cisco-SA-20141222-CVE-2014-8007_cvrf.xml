  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Prime Infrastructure could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view the passwords stored for device discovery.



The vulnerability occurs because the Quick Discovery options page contains the stored password in the HMTL page source. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inspecting the HTML source of the page.



Proof-of-concept code that exploits this vulnerability is publicly available.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released updated software.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have authenticated access to the affected device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
