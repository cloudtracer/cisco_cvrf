  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in processing network traffic of the Cisco Unified IP Conference Station 7937G could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.



The vulnerability is due to resource constraints in processing a high rate of network traffic. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of TCP packets to the device. An exploit could allow the attacker to render the device unable to communicate on the network until the DoS condition ends.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send a high rate of TCP packets to the affected device. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that proof-of-concept exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
