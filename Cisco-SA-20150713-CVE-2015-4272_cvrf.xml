  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in several parameters of the ccmivr page of Cisco Unified Communications Manager, formerly known as CallManager, could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface on an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of some parameters used by the ccmivr page of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the system to follow an attacker-supplied link. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause arbitrary script or HTML to be executed on the user's browser within the context of the affected application.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
