  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A
vulnerability in the Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) of Cisco Unified
Computing System could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access
services with elevated privileges.



The vulnerability is due to
improper filtering of SSH escape sequences. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by using SSH port forwarding to bypass additional authentication. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to access certain services with elevated
privileges.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement limits the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
