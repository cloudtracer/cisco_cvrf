  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Session Manager software of Cisco Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Session Manager to crash.



The issue is due to insufficient validation of received TCP packets. An attacker could exploit this issue by sending a crafted TCP packet. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the Session Manager process to crash.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks behind a firewall to send crafted TCP packets to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit. 



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
