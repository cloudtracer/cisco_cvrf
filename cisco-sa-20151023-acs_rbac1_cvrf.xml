    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation of the Cisco Secure Access Control Server (ACS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view system administrator reports and status.

 

The vulnerability is due to improper RBAC validation when a user accesses the report generation web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a non-privileged user and navigating to what should be a restricted web page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view confidential report and status information about the affected device, including IP addresses and usernames.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
