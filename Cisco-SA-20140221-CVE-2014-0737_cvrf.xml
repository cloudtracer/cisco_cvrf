  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Certificate Trust List (CTL) authentication of Cisco third-generation IP phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject a crafted CTL file to the IP phone.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication of the CTL file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted CTL file to the phone. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the phone to trust systems under the attacker's control.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to inject a crafted CTL file to a targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
