  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the administration portal of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass role restrictions.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient role restriction processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by revisiting the link to a previously denied location of the administration portal. An exploit could allow the attacker to access sections of the administration portal to which the attacker does not have role-based access.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to a targeted device. This access requirement reduces the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
