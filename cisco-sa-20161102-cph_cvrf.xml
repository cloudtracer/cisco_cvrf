  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web-based graphical user interface (GUI) of Cisco Prime
Home could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass
authentication. The attacker could be granted full administrator privileges.



The
vulnerability is due to a processing error in the role-based access control (RBAC) of URLs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
a crafted HTTP request to a particular URL. An exploit could allow
the attacker to obtain a valid session identifier for an arbitrary user, which
would allow the attacker to perform any actions in Cisco Prime Home for
which that user is authorized?including users with administrator privileges.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
