  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Computing System B-Series Blade Servers could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain shell-level access to the affected device.




The vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the ping6 and the traceroute6 commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command in the command-line interface.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may need local system access to the targeted system under the local-mgmt context. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
