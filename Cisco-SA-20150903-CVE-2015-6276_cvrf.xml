  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the directory on the Web Management Interface of Cisco TelePresence IX5000 Systems could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to decrypt captured traffic on the affected device or perform a man-in-the-middle attack.



The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of the certificate directory as a public resource. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by downloading the private and public side of the X.509 certificate that protects the HTTP channel to the Web Management Interface. This certificate secures the HTTP channel of the Web Management Interface only; Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP), and other communication channels are secured using the provisioned certificate from the associated Cisco Unified Communications Manager. An exploit could allow the attacker to use the private side of the certificate to decrypt previously captured traffic between a management session and the affected IX5000 or to impersonate an IX5000 device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. Therefore, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by downloading the public and private key for the default self-signed certificate. Gaining access to the keys could allow the attacker to use them in future attacks to decrypt captured traffic on an affected device or conduct a man-in-the-middle attack.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
