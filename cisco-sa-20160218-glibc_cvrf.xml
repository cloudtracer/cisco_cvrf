  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">On February 16, 2016, an industry-wide, critical vulnerability in the GNU C library (glibc) was publicly disclosed.



Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of glibc that may be affected by the vulnerability. The vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a buffer overflow condition that may result in a denial of service (DoS) condition or allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device.



Cisco will release software updates that address this vulnerability.



Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.

  <Vulnerability Ordinal="1" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1">
    <Title>Glibc libresolv Library Stack-Based Buffer Overflow Vulnerability</Title>
    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the libresolv library in GNC glibc could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software when the getaddrinfo function is used while performing dual A/AAAA DNS queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted DNS response to a targeted system. An exploit could trigger a stack-based buffer overflow condition that the attacker could leverage to execute arbitrary code or cause a DoS condition.</Note>
