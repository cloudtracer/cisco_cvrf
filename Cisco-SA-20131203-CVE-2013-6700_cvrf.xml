  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) module of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the SNMP process on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper processing of SNMP requests for certain MIBs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an SNMP request for certain MIB objects. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the SNMP process on an affected device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
