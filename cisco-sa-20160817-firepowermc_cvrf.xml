  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco Firepower Management Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface of an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation for some of the parameters that are passed to an affected web server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to access a malicious link or by intercepting a user request and injecting malicious code into the request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected site or allow the attacker to access sensitive browser-based information.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
