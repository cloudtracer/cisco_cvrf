  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the local-mgmt context in Cisco Unified
Computing System Central Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to
gain shell-level access to the affected device.



The
vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the copy command.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command in the command-line interface.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access to the targeted device. This access requirement may decrease the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
