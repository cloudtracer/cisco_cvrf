  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in a deprecated page in Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Application Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions imposed by the affected software that could allow arbitrary code execution. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the security context of the application. A successful exploit could be leveraged to conduct further attacks.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and software updates available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
