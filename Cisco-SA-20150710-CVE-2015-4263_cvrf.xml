  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Control And Provisioning of the Cisco Mobility Services Engine (MSE) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to have read access to sensitive information stored on an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to the inclusion of sensitive information in certain log files. An attacker could exploit this by viewing the sensitive information stored in the vulnerable log files.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
