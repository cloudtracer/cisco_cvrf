  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager application could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the web interface on an affected system.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link. If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary script or HTML code in the user's browser session.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, updated software is not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
