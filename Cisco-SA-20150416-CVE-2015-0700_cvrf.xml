  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Dashboard page in the monitoring and report section of Cisco Secure Access Control Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack.



The vulnerability is due to the improper generation and validation of the CSRF token by an affected system. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions on the targeted system on behalf of the user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to convince the user to follow the link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
