    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager Platform Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to login with the privileges of the root user and take full control of the affected system.



The vulnerability occurs because a privileged account has a default and static password. This account is created at installation and cannot be changed or deleted without impacting the functionality of the system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by remotely connecting to the affected system via SSH using this account. An exploit could allow the attacker to take full control over the affected system.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are not available.
