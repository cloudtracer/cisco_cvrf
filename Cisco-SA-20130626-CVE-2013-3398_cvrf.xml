  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in web framework could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to access information about internal file system resources such as paths and names of
files and directories.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient security hardening of replies to crafted HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected system
and observe the response from the system. An exploit could allow the
attacker to access confidential information about the affected system such
as file system organization, paths, and names of files and directories.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
