  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the bookmarklet.jsp page of Cisco SocialMiner could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected device to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. An exploit could allow the attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
