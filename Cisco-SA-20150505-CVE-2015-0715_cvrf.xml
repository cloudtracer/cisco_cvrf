  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform SQL injection attacks. 



The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the administrative web interface and submitting a crafted response to the affected pages. If successful, the attacker could access sensitive information stored in the database of the targeted device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the affected application on a targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
