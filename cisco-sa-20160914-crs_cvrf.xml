    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in IPv6 over MPLS packet processing of Cisco IOS XR for Cisco Carrier Routing System (CRS) platforms could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a reload of the affected line card.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient logic in processing of crafted IPv6 over MPLS packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPv6 over MPLS packet to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected line card.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
