  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the IPv6 packet decode function of the Cisco Network Analysis Module (NAM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. 



The vulnerability is due to an improper calculation of the IPv6 payload length of certain IPv6 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 packets on the network where the NAM is collecting and monitoring traffic. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition and the NAM could cease to collect and monitor traffic for a short time.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
