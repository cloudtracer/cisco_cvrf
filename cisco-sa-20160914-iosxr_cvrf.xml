  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the OSPFv3 processing of Cisco IOS XR Software for Cisco Network Convergence System (NCS) 6000 Series devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the OSPFv3 process and result in a limited denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient logic in the processing of crafted OSPFv3 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted OSPFv3 packets to be processed by an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the OSPFv3 process and cause a limited DoS condition on the affected device.



Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that address this vulnerability are not available.
