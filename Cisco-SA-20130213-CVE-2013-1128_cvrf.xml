  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Server contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery attacks. 



The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input processed by the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace software. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to follow a malicious link that is designed to submit malicious requests to the affected software. If successful, the attacker could affect several web pages and parameters, which could be used to conduct further attacks on the system.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and software updates are available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>

      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified MeetingPlace Server contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the user of the web interface. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to submit arbitrary requests to the affected device via the affected web browser with the privileges of the user.</Note>
