  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal (CVP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user on the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform unauthorized actions via the web browser with the privileges of the user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
