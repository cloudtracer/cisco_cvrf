    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">The Cisco IOS IP Service Level Agreement (IP SLA) feature contains a
denial of service (DoS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered when
malformed UDP packets are sent to a vulnerable device. The vulnerable UDP port
numbers depend on the device configuration. Default ports are not used for the
vulnerable UDP IP SLA operation or for the UDP responder ports.

Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. 

This advisory is posted at
http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-ipsla["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20110928-ipsla"].


Note: The September 28, 2011, Cisco IOS Software
Security Advisory bundled publication includes ten Cisco Security Advisories.
Nine of the advisories address vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS Software, and one
advisory addresses vulnerabilities in Cisco Unified Communications Manager.
Each advisory lists the Cisco IOS Software releases that correct the
vulnerability or vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory as well as the Cisco
IOS Software releases that correct all vulnerabilities in the September 2011
Bundled Publication.

    <Remediations>
      <Remediation Type="Workaround">
        <Description>There are no workarounds for this vulnerability, but there are
mitigations that can be deployed on a general IP SLA responder to reduce the
exposure to this vulnerability. 

General IP SLA Responder Mitigation
For devices that are configured as general responders, a mitigation is
to restrict IP SLA control packets on UDP port 1967 that are addressed to the
vulnerable device to permit only trusted probe originators to open UDP ports
that could be exploited. This can be accomplished using techniques such as
Infrastructure Access list or Control Plane Protection.

For devices configured as general responders, mitigation techniques
that can be deployed on Cisco devices within the network are available in the
Cisco Applied Mitigation Bulletin companion document for this advisory:

http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-ipsla.["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-ipsla"]


["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoAppliedMitigationBulletin/cisco-amb-20110928-ipsla"]

IP SLA Permanent Responder Mitigation
For the permanent responder, the mitigation is to filter UDP packets
addressed to the configured UDP port of each permanent responder to permit
packets from the IP addresses of trusted devices. 

IP SLA Source Devices Mitigation
For IP SLA source devices, a mitigation is to allow only UDP packets
from trusted devices (that is, devices that are the target of IP SLA
operations)
