  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of the Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute commands on the underlying operating system.



The vulnerability is due to improper authorization of read-only users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted HTTP requests to the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to modify existing entries or add new entries in the Unified Communications lookup page.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




An authenticated, remote attacker could utilize this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the targeted device. Devices utilizing default configuration settings are vulnerable to this exploit.



To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires authenticated access to the targeted system. Authenticated access may require the attacker to access trusted, internal networks. These requirements could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
