  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Multiple Cisco products incorporate a version of the Network Time Protocol daemon (ntpd) package. Versions of this package are affected by one or more vulnerabilities that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or modify the time being advertised by a device acting as a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server.



On June 2, 2016, the NTP Consortium of the Network Time Foundation released a security notice that details five issues regarding DoS vulnerabilities and logic issues that may allow an attacker to shift a system's time. 



The new vulnerabilities disclosed in this document are as follows:




    Network Time Protocol CRYPTO-NAK Denial of Service Vulnerability
    Network Time Protocol Bad Authentication Demobilizes Ephemeral Associations Vulnerability
    Network Time Protocol Processing Spoofed Server Packets Vulnerability
    Network Time Protocol Autokey Association Reset Vulnerability
    Network Time Protocol Broadcast Interleave Vulnerability

Additional details about each vulnerability are in the NTP Consortium Security Notice["http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#April_2016_NTP_4_2_8p7_Security"].



Cisco will release software updates that address these vulnerabilities.



Workarounds that address one or more of these vulnerabilities may be available and will be documented in the Cisco bug for each affected product.

    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Network Time Protocol (NTP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a reload of the affected ntpd process.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packets from unknown peers. A successful exploit could allow a malicious unauthenticated peer to cause a reload of the affected ntpd process.</Note>

      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="5">A vulnerability in Network Time Protocol (NTP) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect some peer variables.



The vulnerability is due to improper validation of packets from peers. A successful exploit could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to spoof valid peers and affect some peer variables and, for example, cause a false leap indication to be set.
