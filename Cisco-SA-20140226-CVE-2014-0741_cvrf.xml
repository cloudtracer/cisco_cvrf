  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Certificate Authority Proxy Function (CAPF) command-line function for certificate import of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read or write arbitrary files to the underlying operating system.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering a crafted command-line entry. An exploit could allow the attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the underlying operating system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need local access to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
