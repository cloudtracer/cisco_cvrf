    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the ''Files Available for Download'' window of Cisco Intelligent Automation for Cloud could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to download arbitrary files from the system.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to perform sufficient server-side validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using an intercepting proxy to submit specially crafted requests for arbitrary system files.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to authenticated to the targeted device, which decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.
