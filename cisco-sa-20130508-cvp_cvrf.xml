    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software (Unified CVP) contains multiple vulnerabilities. Various components of Cisco Unified CVP are affected; see the "Details" section for more information on the vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be exploited independently; however, more than one vulnerability could be exploited on the same device.



Cisco has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. Workarounds that mitigate some of these vulnerabilities are available.

To implement the
workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability, the communication
between the Cisco Unified CVP devices must be secured using SSL.  For more information on how to secure the communications between Cisco Unified CVP devices, refer to the "Unified CVP security" section of the Configuration and Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal at the following location:

To implement the
workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Manager web applications:




Stop the services of respective server:

The ?manager? and ?host-manager? web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.


CVP VXML Server

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Call

the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Reporting Server

Go
to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete
the Manager and Host-Manager folders.

CSCub38379["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).



To implement the
workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:



Stop the service of VXML Server:



Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.



Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.




None of the other vulnerabilities published in this document have workarounds.

        <Description>A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCub38366["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38366"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).



To implement the
workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability, the communication
between the Cisco Unified CVP devices must be secured using SSL.  For more information on how to secure the communications between Cisco Unified CVP devices, refer to the "Unified CVP security" section of the Configuration and Administration Guide for Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal at the following location:

A workaround is available for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal
Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCub38384["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38384"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).




To implement the
workaround for the Cisco Unified Customer Voice Portal Software Tomcat Web Application Vulnerability, the Manager and Host-Manager web applications must be removed manually from the Tomcat instances on CVP servers. Follow the instructions to remove the Manager and Host-Manager web applications:




Stop the services of respective server:

The ?manager? and ?host-manager? web applications need to be manually removed from Tomcat instances of your CVP servers.


CVP VXML Server

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Call
Server

Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Operation
Console Server

Go to the
C:\Cisco\CVP\OPSConsoleServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete
the Manager and Host-Manager folders.



CVP Reporting Server

Go
to the C:\Cisco\CVP\CallServer\Tomcat\server\webapps folder. Delete
the Manager and Host-Manager folders.


A workaround is available for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance documented in Cisco Bug ID
CSCub38379["https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCub38379"] (registered["http://tools.cisco.com/RPF/register/register.do"] customers only).



To implement the
workaround for the CVP: Insecure Tomcat Configuration Instance, follow these steps:



Stop the service of VXML Server:



Go to the C:\Cisco\CVP\VXMLServer\Tomcat\conf folder and edit server.xml file.



Modify autoDeploy to false. Earlier it was true.




None of the other vulnerabilities published in this document have workarounds.
