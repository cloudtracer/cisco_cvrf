  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in a PHP file in the Cisco WebEx MeetMeNow Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain the contents of arbitrary files on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of user input.  An exploit could allow the attacker to view the contents of any file that is readable by the Apache service account.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
