  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Cisco Unified MeetingPlace application could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to obtain sensitive information.



The Cisco Unified MeetingPlace application does not always properly validate the session ID in the HTTP URL. This could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information about a session to use to compromise the application.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
