  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the SSL implementation of the Cisco Nexus 1000V could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against Virtual Supervisor Module (VSM) to VMware vCenter communications.



The vulnerability is due to improper verification of SSL security certificates by the VSM. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to eavesdrop on communications, and to inject modified or arbitrary data.



Cisco would like to thank Felix 'FX' Lindner, Recurity Labs GmbH, for reporting this issue to us.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would likely need access to a trusted, internal network in which the targeted device may reside and have access to the communication path between the VSM and vCenter server. These access restrictions limits the possibility of a successful exploit.



Customers are advised to review the bug reports in the "Vendor Announcements" section for a current list of affected versions.</Note>

        <Description>Administrators are advised to contact the vendor regarding future updates and releases.



Administrators are advised to allow only trusted users to have network access.



It is critical to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices. Restrict network traffic destined for the network infrastructure to protect against reconnaissance and denial of service attacks. For configuration details, see Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk648/tk361/technologies_white_paper09186a00801a1a55.shtml"].



Administrators are advised to monitor affected systems.</Description>
