  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the command-line interface (CLI) of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco UCM) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files.



The vulnerability is due to incomplete input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing a crafted command on the CLI. An exploit could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files on the local file system.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access to the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
