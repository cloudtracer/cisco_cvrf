  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in the web user interface of the Cisco Video Surveillance 5000 Series HD IP Dome Cameras could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.



The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted URL.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit these vulnerabilities, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.</Note>
