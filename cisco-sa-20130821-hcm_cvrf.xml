The
vulnerability is due to the improper handling of TCP packets sent to the Omnibus Port (port 5400). An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending a TCP flood to the affected port.  An
exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a disk exhaustion condition which could disrupt services and cause a DoS condition on the affected system.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-3387</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-188692</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188694</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory could allow a remote attacker to trigger a memory leak or DoS condition that could interrupt services.</Description></Threat></Threats><CVSSScoreSets><ScoreSet><BaseScore>7.8</BaseScore><TemporalScore>6.4</TemporalScore><Vector>AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/</Vector></ScoreSet></CVSSScoreSets><Remediations><Remediation Type="Workaround"><Description>No workarounds are available for these vulnerabilities.</Description></Remediation></Remediations><References><Reference Type="Self"><URL>http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130821-hcm</URL><Description>Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution Assurance Denial of Service Vulnerabilities</Description></Reference></References></Vulnerability><Vulnerability Ordinal="2" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1"><Title>Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution Assurance  TCP Flood on Prime Central Ephemeral Java Port Vulnerability</Title><ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCtz92776</ID><Notes><Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="2">Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) Assurance

The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of TCP packets sent to the Prime Central Ephemeral Java Port (port 44444). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of TCP packets to the affected port. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume all available memory and cause a DoS condition on the affected system.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-3388</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-188692</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188694</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory could allow a remote attacker to trigger a memory leak or DoS condition that could interrupt services.</Description></Threat></Threats><CVSSScoreSets><ScoreSet><BaseScore>7.8</BaseScore><TemporalScore>6.4</TemporalScore><Vector>AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/</Vector></ScoreSet></CVSSScoreSets><Remediations><Remediation Type="Workaround"><Description>No workarounds are available for these vulnerabilities.</Description></Remediation></Remediations><References><Reference Type="Self"><URL>http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130821-hcm</URL><Description>Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution Assurance Denial of Service Vulnerabilities</Description></Reference></References></Vulnerability><Vulnerability Ordinal="3" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1"><Title>Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution Assurance TCP Flood on ActiveMQ Broker Ports Vulnerability</Title><ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCtz90114</ID><Notes><Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="3">Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) Assurance contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote

The vulnerability is due to excessive memory consumption by the affected software while processing large amounts of TCP packets. An attacker could exploit
this vulnerability by sending a TCP flood to the affected ports.  An
exploit could allow the attacker to disrupt services and cause a denial
of service condition on the affected system.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-3389</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-188692</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188694</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory could allow a remote attacker to trigger a memory leak or DoS condition that could interrupt services.</Description></Threat></Threats><CVSSScoreSets><ScoreSet><BaseScore>7.8</BaseScore><TemporalScore>6.4</TemporalScore><Vector>AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/</Vector></ScoreSet></CVSSScoreSets><Remediations><Remediation Type="Workaround"><Description>No workarounds are available for these vulnerabilities.</Description></Remediation></Remediations><References><Reference Type="Self"><URL>http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130821-hcm</URL><Description>Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution Assurance Denial of Service Vulnerabilities</Description></Reference></References></Vulnerability><Vulnerability Ordinal="4" xmlns="http://www.icasi.org/CVRF/schema/vuln/1.1"><Title>Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution Assurance TCP Flood on Impact Ephemeral Ports Vulnerability</Title><ID SystemName="Cisco Bug ID">CSCub59158</ID><Notes><Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="4">Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution (HCS) Assurance contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated,

The vulnerability
is due to a memory leak in the processing of TCP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a TCP connection flood to the ephemeral ports.  A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to disrupt services and create a DoS
condition on the affected system.</Note></Notes><CVE>CVE-2013-3390</CVE><ProductStatuses><Status Type="Known Affected"><ProductID>CVRFPID-188692</ProductID><ProductID>CVRFPID-188694</ProductID></Status></ProductStatuses><Threats><Threat Type="Impact"><Description>Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory could allow a remote attacker to trigger a memory leak or DoS condition that could interrupt services.</Description></Threat></Threats><CVSSScoreSets><ScoreSet><BaseScore>7.8</BaseScore><TemporalScore>6.4</TemporalScore><Vector>AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C/</Vector></ScoreSet></CVSSScoreSets><Remediations><Remediation Type="Workaround"><Description>No workarounds are available for these vulnerabilities.</Description></Remediation></Remediations><References><Reference Type="Self"><URL>http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130821-hcm</URL><Description>Cisco Prime Central for Hosted Collaboration Solution Assurance Denial of Service Vulnerabilities</Description></Reference></References></Vulnerability></cvrfdoc>
