  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

 

The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the affected software. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user to click a crafted URL that is designed to submit malicious code to the affected software.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerabilities; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
