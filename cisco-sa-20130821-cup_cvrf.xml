    <Notes>
      <Note Title="Summary" Type="Summary" Ordinal="1">Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM and Presence Service contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service on an affected device.



The vulnerability is due to a memory leak. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a large number of connections to TCP port 5060 and 5061. Successful exploitation could cause a memory leak on an affected device that could interrupt presence services, resulting in a DoS condition.
