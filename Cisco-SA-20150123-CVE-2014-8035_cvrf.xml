  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the web framework of Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to enumerate valid user accounts.



The vulnerability is due to improper sanitization of a returned message. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URL requests to a vulnerable device.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and released updated software.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may need access to trusted or internal networks to transmit crafted URL requests to the targeted system. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
