  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communication Domain Manager (UCDM) Application Software version 10 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the web server to become unresponsive. As a result, connections to the Cisco UCDM GUI will not be possible during the attack.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient implementation of flooding attack controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed TCP packets at a high rate to the affected web server.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice and has released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may require access to trusted, internal networks to send crafted requests to the affected software. This access requirement could limit the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
