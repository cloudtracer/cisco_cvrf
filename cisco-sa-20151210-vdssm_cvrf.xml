  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) for certain users of the Cisco Videoscape Distribution Suite Service Manager (VDS-SM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker read and write access to an internal database that contains sensitive information.



The vulnerability is due to lack of implementation of RBAC where authentication of certain user accounts for back-end database access is performed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the application, allowing them to access the internal database through the GUI or by crafting an HTTP request. An exploit could allow the attacker to have read and write access to sensitive information in the back-end database, which should be restricted.



Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.
