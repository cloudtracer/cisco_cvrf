  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in TFTP in Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) Expressway could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to obtain unauthorized access to configuration files from the device by using TFTP.



The vulnerability is due to lack of TFTP authentication and control for the privilege level needed to obtain a configuration file from the device. An attacker with the Mobile and Remote Access (MRA) role could exploit the vulnerability by using TFTP to obtain unauthorized access to configuration files. An exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive information in the configuration file.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate and have the MRA role on the targeted device. These requirements may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
