  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the wireless web authentication subsystem of Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.



The vulnerability exists due to improper input sanitization of a certain value that is supplied by a user prior to successfully authenticating to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a request designed to trigger the vulnerability and cause a process crash that will trigger a restart of the device, resulting in a DoS condition.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the same broadcast or collision domain as the targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
