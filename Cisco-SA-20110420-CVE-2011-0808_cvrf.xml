  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">Oracle Outside In Technology components used by the Oracle Fusion Middleware applications contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.

The vulnerability exists due to incorrect processing of Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet files (WKS) and Microsoft Cabinet (CAB) files by the affected software.  An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to view malicious files using an application that relies upon Outside In Technology libraries.  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.

Oracle has confirmed the vulnerability and released updated software.





To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to convince a targeted user to open a malicious file with the affected software.  To achieve this objective, the attacker might use social engineering techniques and send the malicious file as an e-mail attachment, via instant messaging or other forms of communication.

CVSS scoring from the vendor indicates partial availability impact exploitable by a local attacker.  This scoring may reflect the impact to a system using the affected libraries to develop applications or the possible introduction of errors during development.  However, as described in this alert, other reports indicate that an unauthenticated, remote attacker could leverage the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on a system with the privileges of the user.  By convincing a user to view a malicious file on a system that uses the vulnerable libraries, an attacker could execute arbitrary code on an affected system with the privileges of the targeted user.

Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.
