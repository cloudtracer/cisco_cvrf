  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Communications Manager could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform SQL injection. This could allow the attacker to obtain information the affected application can access.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the administrative web interface and submitting a crafted response to the affected page.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must authenticate to the targeted device. This access requirement may reduce the likelihood of a successful exploit.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
