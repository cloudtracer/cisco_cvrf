  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Certificate Authority Proxy Function (CAPF) of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to impact the integrity of the system by executing arbitrary SQL queries.



The vulnerability is due to a failure to validate user-supplied input
used in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending crafted URLs that include SQL statements. An exploit could allow
the attacker to determine the presence of certain values in the
database.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
