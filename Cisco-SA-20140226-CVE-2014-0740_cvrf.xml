  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the OS Administration page of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Cisco Unified CM) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the OS Administration web interface.



The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections on the Call Detail Records (CDR) Analysis and Reporting (CAR) web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause changes to OS Administration on behalf of the user.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability in a security notice; however, software updates are not available.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
