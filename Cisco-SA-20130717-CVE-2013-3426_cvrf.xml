  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the Serviceability servlet of fourth-generation Cisco IP phones could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to download arbitrary files from the phone's file system.



The vulnerability is due to incomplete filtering of path values. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing a valid path in a file request in the URL passed to the phone. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve an arbitrary file from the IP phone.



Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security notice and released software updates.




To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker may need access to trusted, internal networks to submit a request to a targeted device. This access requirement decreases the likelihood of a successful exploit.</Note>
