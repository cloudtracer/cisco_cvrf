  <DocumentNotes>
    <Note Title="Summary" Type="General" Ordinal="1">A vulnerability in the CUCReports page of Cisco Unity Connection could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to perform a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack against the CUCReports web interface.

 

The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections on the Cisco Unity Connection web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading an authenticated user of the affected system to follow a malicious link or visit an attacker-controlled website.



Cisco has confirmed the vulnerability and released software updates.




To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to convince the user to follow the link.



Cisco indicates through the CVSS score that functional exploit code exists; however, the code is not known to be publicly available.</Note>
